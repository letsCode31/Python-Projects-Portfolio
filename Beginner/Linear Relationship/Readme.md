# Visualizing Linear Relationships

This project demonstrates how to visualize linear relationships between different variables using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. It includes:
1. Plotting a linear equation of the form \( y = mx + c \)
2. Plotting relationships between different Instagram metrics (Likes, Impressions, and Profile Visits) using scatter plots with regression lines.

## Project Structure
- Jupyter Notebook containing the code for visualizing linear relationships and plotting.
- `Instagram data.csv`: Dataset containing Instagram metrics used for plotting.

## Data Description
The dataset (`Instagram data.csv`) taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmotefaker/instagram-data?resource=download includes the following columns:
- **Impressions**: The number of times a post was shown.
- **Likes**: The number of likes on a post.
- **Profile Visits**: The number of visits to the profile.

The plots include both scatter plots and regression lines to show the linear trends.
