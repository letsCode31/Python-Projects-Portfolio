# Tic Tac Toe Game with GUI

This is a Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game supports two modes: 
- Two Players mode
- One Player vs. AI mode

The AI mode uses a simple random selection algorithm for its moves. The game prompts the user to select the mode before starting and asks whether to continue playing after a game ends.

## Features
- **Two Players Mode**: Play against a friend in a two-player match.
- **One Player vs AI Mode**: Play against the computer, with the AI making random moves.
- **Graphical Interface**: User-friendly interface using `tkinter`.
- **Mode Selection and Replay Option**: Choose the game mode before starting and decide whether to replay after each game.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` library (included with most Python installations)
