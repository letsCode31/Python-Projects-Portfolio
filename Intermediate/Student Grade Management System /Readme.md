# Student Grade Management System

This is a Python-based **Student Grade Management System** that allows users to manage student records by adding, updating, and analyzing student grades. The project demonstrates the use of core Python concepts like **tuples, lists, dictionaries, lambda functions, `map`, and `filter` functions**.

## Features

- **Dynamic Data Input**: Enter names and grades for multiple students dynamically.
- **Grade Statistics**:
  - Calculate the **average grade**.
  - Find the **highest and lowest grades**.
- **Filtering**:
  - List students who **passed** (grade â‰¥ 50).
  - List students who **failed** (grade < 50).
- **Sorting**:
  - Sort students **alphabetically by name**.
  - Sort students **by grade** (highest to lowest).
- **Add/Update Students**:
  - Add new students or update existing student records dynamically.

- Core Python concepts:
  - **Tuples**: For storing immutable pairs of student names and grades.
  - **Lists**: For managing collections of student records.
  - **Dictionaries**: For fast lookups and updates of student data.
  - **Lambda Functions**: For concise, inline operations.
  - **`map` Function**: For transforming lists (e.g., extracting grades).
  - **`filter` Function**: For selecting data based on conditions.
