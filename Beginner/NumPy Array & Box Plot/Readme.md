# Sorting NumPy Arrays and Box Plot Visualization

This project demonstrates how to sort NumPy arrays in Python and visualize the sorted data using a box plot. It also covers adding outliers to the dataset and identifying statistical measures such as quartiles, median, and extreme values.

## Project Overview
1. **Sort NumPy Arrays**: Generate a NumPy array of random numbers, sort the array in both asscending and descending order, and add outliers to demonstrate how they appear on a box plot.
2. **Box Plot Visualization**: Use a box plot to visualize the distribution of the data, highlighting the presence of outliers.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate and display key statistical values including the lower quartile (Q1), median (Q2), upper quartile (Q3), interquartile range (IQR), and extreme values.

## Features
- Generates an array of 50 random integers between 1 and 100.
- Introduces outliers to the dataset for demonstration purposes.
- Sorts the array in both ascending and descending order.
- Calculates statistical measures: Q1, Q2, Q3, IQR, lower extreme, and upper extreme.
- Visualizes the data using a box plot to show the distribution and highlight the outliers
