# Dice Roll Simulator

A simple Python program that simulates rolling a dice and displays the result. The program allows the user to roll the dice multiple times if they wish.

## Features
- Simulates rolling a six-sided dice (numbers 1 to 6).
- Allows the user to continue rolling the dice until they choose to stop.
- Displays the result of each dice roll.

## How It Works
1. The program uses Python's `random` library to generate a random number between 1 and 6, simulating the roll of a six-sided dice.
2. After each roll, the program asks if the user wants to roll the dice again.
3. If the user inputs "yes," the dice is rolled again. If the user inputs anything else, the program ends.
