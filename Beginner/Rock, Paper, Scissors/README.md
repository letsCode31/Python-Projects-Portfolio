# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A simple two-player Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python. The notebook contains two different implementations:
1. A game between a player and the computer, where the computer's choice is randomly generated.
2. A game between two players, where both players input their choices.

## When Playing Against the Computer:
- The player selects "rock," "paper," or "scissors," while the computer randomly picks one of the three options.
- The winner is determined based on the rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors.
  - Scissors beat Paper.
  - Paper beats Rock.
- The game provides feedback on whether the player wins, loses, or if itâ€™s a tie.
- The player can choose to play multiple rounds until they decide to stop.

## When Playing with Two Players:
- Each player enters their choice: "rock," "paper," or "scissors."
- The game automatically prompts both players to input their choices again if there's a tie.
- The winner is determined according to the rules mentioned above.

## Running the Game
- This game was developed using a Jupyter Notebook.
- To run the game:
  1. Download the notebook to your local machine and open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
  2. Alternatively, you can run the notebook in an online Jupyter environment like Google Colab.
