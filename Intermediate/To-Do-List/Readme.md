# Python To-Do List Application

This is a Python-based To-Do List application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using `tkinter`. The app allows users to manage their tasks, mark them as complete, edit task names, and delete specific tasks.

## Project Description

- **Add Tasks**: Enter new tasks, which are automatically numbered.
- **Mark as Complete**: Mark tasks as completed, changing their appearance in the list to visually indicate theyâ€™re done.
- **Edit Tasks**: Edit the text of uncompleted tasks for corrections or updates.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove specific tasks from the list.
